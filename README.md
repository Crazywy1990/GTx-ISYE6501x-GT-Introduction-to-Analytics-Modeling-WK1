# GTx-ISYE6501x-GT-Introduction-to-Analytics-Modeling

Hi Everyone,

Welcome to ISYE6501x Introduction to Analytics Modeling! I’m excited to start!

This semester, we will cover a lot of important and valuable skills and knowledge – mostly about a wide variety of analytics models, but also including cross-cutting analytics modeling concepts and some cases. You will also get experience using analytics software. In course outline, you’ll see Modules and Lessons noted with “M” (modeling), “C” (cross-cutting concept), or “X” (experiential), when each type of material is introduced. Most video lessons come with a quick knowledge check at the end, to make sure you’ve understood the most critical concept or two.

Each week, learners are expected to review the video lessons and complete the homework. I see homework as more of a learning tool than a grading tool, so I encourage you to get on the discussion forum and discuss the homework with each other – make sure you really learn as much as you can, and help others to learn too. Everyone needs to turn in their own homework solutions, but you’ll learn more if you talk with each other first. The same is true about the course project, which is a three-week-long assignment.

There will be three quizzes: two midterm quizzes that will focus on models and concepts, and one final quiz that will focus on using and combining models into an analytics solution. For each midterm quiz, learners can use one sheet of paper (both sizes) with handwritten notes for reference. For the final quiz, learners can use two sheets.

The bottom line in this course is that I want you to learn as much as you can. That includes what I teach directly in the videos, what you learn individually as you learn analytics software in the homework assignments, and what you learn and teach each other in the discussion forums. For those of you in the Verified Certificate cohort, my horde of teaching assistants and I will be there to answer questions, provide guidance, and further your learning. With all of these resources, you can learn a very large amount in this course – let’s do it!
